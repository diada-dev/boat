You are sailing on a spring river boat during ice drift. Your task is to save people among the ice floes. But at the same time, you yourself need not to crash into the ice floe.

Added fire functions able to melt ice. But be careful not to kill people or to explode on a barrel of gasoline.

I hope you enjoy the ported version of the game.:)
